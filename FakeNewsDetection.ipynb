Police fired tear gas on Thursday at the protesting students. Video footage posted on social media later in the day showed uniformed officers outside dormitories and inside classrooms using batons to hit people who did not appear to be involved in the campus protests.  It was the latest crackdown by police on protests since an Aug. 8 presidential election that was later annulled by the Supreme Court. A re-run of the vote has been set for Oct. 26. The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)  this morning noted from social media reports of an incident in which members of the National Police Service allegedly stormed the University of Nairobi and assaulted students at the institution,  the authority said on its Twitter feed.  It requested that any member of the public come forward to provide information to aid the investigation.  The students had been protesting against the re-arrest of a lawmaker, Paul Ongili Owino, on Wednesday, shortly after he was released on bail on charges of subversion for calling President Uhuru Kenyatta a  son of a dog  at a campaign rally. Kenya is a key Western ally in a region often roiled by violence. Preparations for the re-run of the election are being closely monitored for signs of instability, after at least 28 people were killed in unrest following the Aug. 8 vote. The IPOA watchdog was created in 2011, after police came under severe criticism for the number of protesters killed during demonstrations against disputed elections in 2007. The violence then killed around 1,2000 people. But local and international rights groups say the institution is struggling to fulfill its mandate to investigate allegations of police brutality in a country rife with reports from civilians of extrajudicial killings by security forces.  The IPOA has secured two convictions of police officers in the four years it has been operational. The watchdog pledged last month to fast-track investigations into high-profile deaths such as that of a baby allegedly killed by police in the violence after the election. [L4N1L34FC] But people familiar with the status of these investigations say the police are not cooperating with them, and that senior officials in the police force and the interior ministry insist officers killed only thieves and thugs. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Five Iraqi passengers and one Yemeni were barred from boarding an EgyptAir flight from Cairo to New York on Saturday after President Donald Trump halted the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, sources at Cairo airport said. The passengers, arriving in transit to Cairo airport, were stopped and re-directed to flights headed for their home countries despite holding valid visas, the sources said.  Trump on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, saying the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. He said his most sweeping use of his presidential powers since taking office a week ago, barring travelers from the seven nations for at least 90 days, would give his administration time to develop more stringent screening procedures for refugees, immigrants and visitors. \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don\\u2019t want them here,\\u201d Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon. \\u201cWe only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people,\\u201d he said. The bans, though temporary, took effect immediately, causing havoc and confusion for would-be travelers with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Besides Cairo it was not immediately clear whether other  airports of countries listed by Trump had swiftly implemented the ban. Arab officials of the listed countries would not comment on the matter. The order seeks to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, a move Trump separately said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. That led some legal experts to question whether the order was constitutional. One group said it would announce a court challenge on Monday. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the order targets Muslims because of their faith, contravening the U.S. Constitutional right to freedom of religion. \\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\\u201d said Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  Trump has long pledged to take this kind of action, making it a prominent feature of his campaign for the Nov. 8 election. But people who work with Muslim immigrants and refugees were scrambling to determine the scope of the order. Even legal permanent residents - people with \\u201cgreen cards\\u201d allowing them to live and work in the United States - were being advised to consult immigration lawyers before traveling outside the country, or trying to return, according to Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group in Washington.  On Friday evening, Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said he had fielded about 100 queries from people anxious about the order, which he said he believed could affect traveling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others. \\u201cIt\\u2019s chaos,\\u201d Ayoub said. During his campaign, Trump tapped into American fears about Islamic State militants and the flood of migrants into Europe from Syria\\u2019s civil war, saying refugees could be a \\u201cTrojan horse\\u201d that allowed attackers to enter the United States. In December 2015, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, drawing fire for suggesting a religious test for immigrants that critics said would violate the U.S. Constitution. His idea later evolved into a proposal for \\u201cextreme vetting.\\u201d  Trump\\u2019s order also suspends the Syrian refugee program until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution.  Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there. Legal experts were divided on whether this order would be constitutional. \\u201cIf they are thinking about an exception for Christians, in almost any other legal context discriminating in favor of one religion and against another religion could violate the constitution,\\u201d said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration. But Peter Spiro, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said Trump\\u2019s action would likely be constitutional because the president and Congress are allowed considerable deference when it comes to asylum decisions. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a completely plausible prioritization, to the extent this group is actually being persecuted,\\u201d Spiro said. The order may also affect special refugee programs for Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government as translators after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. It is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants. Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. \\u201cThose two 18-year-old daughters won\\u2019t be able to join their mother in the U.S.,\\u201d she said. Democrats on Friday were quick to condemn Trump\\u2019s order as un-American, saying it would tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land that welcomes immigrants. \\u201cToday\\u2019s executive order from President Trump is more about extreme xenophobia than extreme vetting,\\u201d said Democratic Senator Edward Markey in a statement. Some Republicans praised the move. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said Islamic State has threatened to use the U.S. immigration system, making it important to do more screening. \\u201cI am pleased that President Trump is using the tools granted to him by Congress and the power granted by the Constitution to help keep America safe and ensure we know who is entering the United States,\\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. Without naming Trump, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday it was no time to build walls between nations and criticized steps towards cancelling world trade agreements. Trump on Wednesday ordered the construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. \\u201cToday is not the time to erect walls between nations. They have forgotten that the Berlin wall fell years ago,\\u201d Rouhani said in a speech carried live on Iranian state television. He made no direct reference to Trump\\u2019s order regarding refugees and travelers from the seven mainly Muslim states. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013, thawed Iran\\u2019s relations with world powers after years of confrontation and engineered its 2015 deal with them under which it curbed its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions. Rouhani said earlier this month that Trump could not unilaterally cancel the nuclear deal and that talk of renegotiating it was \\u201cmeaningless\\u201d. France and Germany voiced disquiet on Saturday over Trump\\u2019s new restrictions on immigration. \\u201cWelcoming refugees who flee war and oppression is part of our duty,\\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at a joint news conference with German counterpart Sigmar Gabriel. \\u201cThe United States is a country where Christian traditions have an important meaning. Loving your neighbor is a major Christian value, and that includes helping people,\\u201d said  Gabriel. \\u201cI think that is what unites us in the West, and I think that is what we want to make clear to the Americans.\\u201d \",\n          \"PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo s center-right coalition led by the Democratic Party of Kosovo signed a deal on Monday with the small New Alliance for Kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on June 11.      Finally Kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed,  said Ramush Haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against Serb forces. Under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament.  President Hashim Thaci is expected to give Haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. A source who asked not to be named told Reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. Haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the United Nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005.  The smaller New Alliance for Kosovo party is led by Behgjet Pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest Kosovar.  Pacolli, who also holds a Swiss passport, won many contracts from the Russian government to rebuild state buildings in Moscow in the  90s but a decade ago he moved his business from Moscow to Kazakhstan.  It is unclear what post Pacolli will hold in the new government.  The new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with Kosovo s neighbors, especially Serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the European Union accession process. It must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 Kosovo Serbs who do not recognize independence. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes drove out Serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic Albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 6, 2016\",\n          \"June 10, 2017\",\n          \"Sep 13, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1\",\n          \"0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

divided supreme court struggled with its biggest abortion case in years on wednesday, with pivotal justice anthony kennedy voicing concerns about a restrictive texas law yet stopping short of signaling he would strike it down. the court\\u2019s four liberal justices indicated they believed the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic buildings, intrudes on a woman\\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy established in a 1973 ruling. conservative justices including kennedy expressed doubt during the 85-minute oral argument about claims by abortion providers who asserted that the republican-backed 2013 law forced numerous clinics to shut down. kennedy at one point suggested sending the case back to a lower court to get further evidence on the law\\u2019s impact, including an assessment of the ability of existing texas clinics to meet the demand for abortions. if there is evidence new clinics that meet the state\\u2019s regulations have increased capacity to perform abortions, it would show the law has provided a \\u201cbeneficial effect,\\u201d kennedy said. the outcome appeared to be in the hands of kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close rulings. in past abortion cases, he has backed a fundamental right to abortion while supporting some restrictions. the court was shorthanded with only eight justices following the feb. 13 death of conservative antonin scalia, leaving the liberals and conservatives evenly divided. the best that supporters of the law could hope for would be a 4-4 split that would let stand a lower-court ruling that affirmed the texas regulations but set no nationwide legal precedent on whether other states could enact similar measures. however, a such ruling leaving the texas law intact could encourage other states with anti-abortion legislatures to pass similar laws. kennedy gave little indication he would be willing to uphold the law in full, as his three conservative colleagues would be expected to do. if kennedy sides with the court\\u2019s four liberals, the court could either send the case back to the lower court or strike it down. a ruling is due by the end of june. a decision sending the case to a lower court could mean the dispute might not be resolved for years. some justices questioned the lack of evidence on why specific clinics closed after the law was passed, which could be addressed if new legal proceedings take place. abortion providers assert that the law caused 22 of 41 clinics to close, but the state contests those numbers. \\u201cwhat is the evidence in the record that the closures are related to the legislation?\\u201d conservative chief justice john roberts asked. texas contends the law, passed by a republican-controlled legislature and signed by a republican governor, protects women\\u2019s health. the abortion providers who have challenged it assert that the regulations are aimed at shutting down their clinics. in a sign that he was not comfortable with aspects of the law, kennedy sounded concerned about a possible increase in surgical abortions prompted in part by the state\\u2019s separate new restrictions on medically induced abortions, in which women take pills to terminate a pregnancy. kennedy said that \\u201cthis law has really increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise.\\u201d abortion rights advocates say surgical abortions increased because of the delays women seeking an abortion faced as a result of the 2013 law. liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg questioned the need for a provision of the law requiring clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities, when abortions almost always are low-risk procedures for the woman. \\u201cwhat was the problem the legislature was responding to that it needed to improve the facilities for women\\u2019s health?\\u201d ginsburg asked. the texas law requires abortion doctors to have \\u201cadmitting privileges,\\u201d a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. abortion providers say the provision already has forced clinics to close because such an affiliation is hard to obtain. the abortion providers also challenged a provision, not yet in effect, requiring clinics to have hospital-grade facilities with standards for corridor width, plumbing, parking spaces, room size, the spacing of beds and many other attributes. conservative justice samuel alito indicated support for the regulations and referred to evidence that abortion facilities in texas \\u201chave been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: holes in the floor where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments.\\u201d the supreme court\\u2019s last major abortion ruling came in 2007 when it upheld a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. the supreme court legalized abortion in the 1973 roe v. wade case. but abortion remains a disputed issue in the united states, as it does in many countries, and some states have passed laws aiming to place a variety of restrictions on a woman\\u2019s ability to terminate a pregnancy. the court is considering the texas case in the midst of the heated campaign ahead of the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election.\",\n          \"pristina (reuters) - kosovo s center-right coalition led by the democratic party of kosovo signed a deal on monday with the small new alliance for kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on june 11. finally kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed, said ramush haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against serb forces. under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament. president hashim thaci is expected to give haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. a source who asked not to be named told reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the united nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005. the smaller new alliance for kosovo party is led by behgjet pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest kosovar. pacolli, who also holds a swiss passport, won many contracts from the russian government to rebuild state buildings in moscow in the 90s but a decade ago he moved his business from moscow to kazakhstan. it is unclear what post pacolli will hold in the new government. the new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with kosovo s neighbors, especially serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the european union accession process. it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

divided supreme court struggled with its biggest abortion case in years on wednesday, with pivotal justice anthony kennedy voicing concerns about a restrictive texas law yet stopping short of signaling he would strike it down. the court\\u2019s four liberal justices indicated they believed the law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic buildings, intrudes on a woman\\u2019s constitutional right to end a pregnancy established in a 1973 ruling. conservative justices including kennedy expressed doubt during the 85-minute oral argument about claims by abortion providers who asserted that the republican-backed 2013 law forced numerous clinics to shut down. kennedy at one point suggested sending the case back to a lower court to get further evidence on the law\\u2019s impact, including an assessment of the ability of existing texas clinics to meet the demand for abortions. if there is evidence new clinics that meet the state\\u2019s regulations have increased capacity to perform abortions, it would show the law has provided a \\u201cbeneficial effect,\\u201d kennedy said. the outcome appeared to be in the hands of kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close rulings. in past abortion cases, he has backed a fundamental right to abortion while supporting some restrictions. the court was shorthanded with only eight justices following the feb. 13 death of conservative antonin scalia, leaving the liberals and conservatives evenly divided. the best that supporters of the law could hope for would be a 4-4 split that would let stand a lower-court ruling that affirmed the texas regulations but set no nationwide legal precedent on whether other states could enact similar measures. however, a such ruling leaving the texas law intact could encourage other states with anti-abortion legislatures to pass similar laws. kennedy gave little indication he would be willing to uphold the law in full, as his three conservative colleagues would be expected to do. if kennedy sides with the court\\u2019s four liberals, the court could either send the case back to the lower court or strike it down. a ruling is due by the end of june. a decision sending the case to a lower court could mean the dispute might not be resolved for years. some justices questioned the lack of evidence on why specific clinics closed after the law was passed, which could be addressed if new legal proceedings take place. abortion providers assert that the law caused 22 of 41 clinics to close, but the state contests those numbers. \\u201cwhat is the evidence in the record that the closures are related to the legislation?\\u201d conservative chief justice john roberts asked. texas contends the law, passed by a republican-controlled legislature and signed by a republican governor, protects women\\u2019s health. the abortion providers who have challenged it assert that the regulations are aimed at shutting down their clinics. in a sign that he was not comfortable with aspects of the law, kennedy sounded concerned about a possible increase in surgical abortions prompted in part by the state\\u2019s separate new restrictions on medically induced abortions, in which women take pills to terminate a pregnancy. kennedy said that \\u201cthis law has really increased the number of surgical procedures as opposed to medical procedures, and that this may not be medically wise.\\u201d abortion rights advocates say surgical abortions increased because of the delays women seeking an abortion faced as a result of the 2013 law. liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg questioned the need for a provision of the law requiring clinics to have costly, hospital-grade facilities, when abortions almost always are low-risk procedures for the woman. \\u201cwhat was the problem the legislature was responding to that it needed to improve the facilities for women\\u2019s health?\\u201d ginsburg asked. the texas law requires abortion doctors to have \\u201cadmitting privileges,\\u201d a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. abortion providers say the provision already has forced clinics to close because such an affiliation is hard to obtain. the abortion providers also challenged a provision, not yet in effect, requiring clinics to have hospital-grade facilities with standards for corridor width, plumbing, parking spaces, room size, the spacing of beds and many other attributes. conservative justice samuel alito indicated support for the regulations and referred to evidence that abortion facilities in texas \\u201chave been cited for really appalling violations when they were inspected: holes in the floor where rats could come in, the lack of any equipment to adequately sterilize instruments.\\u201d the supreme court\\u2019s last major abortion ruling came in 2007 when it upheld a federal law banning a late-term abortion procedure. the supreme court legalized abortion in the 1973 roe v. wade case. but abortion remains a disputed issue in the united states, as it does in many countries, and some states have passed laws aiming to place a variety of restrictions on a woman\\u2019s ability to terminate a pregnancy. the court is considering the texas case in the midst of the heated campaign ahead of the nov. 8 u.s. presidential election.\",\n          \"pristina (reuters) - kosovo s center-right coalition led by the democratic party of kosovo signed a deal on monday with the small new alliance for kosovo party to form a government, ending nearly three months of political deadlock after an election on june 11. finally kosovo has started to move ... we had some big delays and our institutions now will be formed, said ramush haradinaj, from the center-right coalition of parties made up of former guerrillas who fought the 1998-99 war against serb forces. under the deal, the parties along with ethnic minorities will secure 63 seats in the 120-seat parliament. president hashim thaci is expected to give haradinaj a mandate to form the government within days. a source who asked not to be named told reuters the parliament session to elect the parliament speaker would be held this week. haradinaj, who twice stood trial before the united nations war crimes court for war crimes and was acquitted, briefly held the post of prime minister in 2005. the smaller new alliance for kosovo party is led by behgjet pacolli, who is dubbed by media the richest kosovar. pacolli, who also holds a swiss passport, won many contracts from the russian government to rebuild state buildings in moscow in the 90s but a decade ago he moved his business from moscow to kazakhstan. it is unclear what post pacolli will hold in the new government. the new government will have to tackle unemployment running at 30 percent and improve relations with kosovo s neighbors, especially serbia, a precondition for both countries to move forward in the european union accession process. it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence. kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008, almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":
